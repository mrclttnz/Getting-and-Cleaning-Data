Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Assignment Codebook
=============================

This is the codebook describing the data, along with the process to get to it, for the Assignement of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera.


### The Course Assignment
The assignment asks to start from data collected from accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone during tests run by Smartlab. The request is to download the raw data from the web site where it's published, process it according to the provided instructions and publish a new tidy dataset.
For clarity, these are the instructions provided for the assignment


> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

> One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

>
> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
> * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
> * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
> * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


In the following sections you can find the descriptions of the raw input data, the output data created and the cleansing process used to build it


### The Raw data
As described in the assignment, the data can be downloaded from here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and a full description can be found at this link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
What follows here is a mix of extract from that documentation and personal notes to add a little more clarity on how the data is structured and how the files relate to each other.
